#  in the FROM field, which is by default the same email as they're being
#  sent to.  However, if you send email to more than one address, then
#  you'll have to set the FROM address manually, to a single address.
#  for example, a 'no-reply@mydomain.com', is better since that tends to
#  tell (most) people that its coming from an automated source.
